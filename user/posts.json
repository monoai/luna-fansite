Thus, like Matsuri, Luna became a salvation for me during the difficult times where I was suffering from a burnout - the cure coming mainly from her piano streams and her pure, curative giggles. Luna's piano stream also, to my delight, helped me rediscover a nearly-forgotten part of my childhood through a song she played. Not to mention, I loved her willpower that not even her low stamina or at times physical injuries could stop her.\n\nWhile I could no longer dedicate myself fully on watching her streams in recent times, I will always be grateful of Luna for saving me from my burnout through her contents.",

I remember watching Himemori Luna when she was around 300,000 subscribers a few years ago. I am very happy to see hime-sama is getting the recognition she deserves. From music to gaming, she has delivered endless fun and enjoyment for all lu-knights. However, Luna-muse has actually had a much larger impact on my life than simply entertainment. This impact is two-fold. First, she was instrumental in helping encourage me in my graduate studies. Her kind words to me, before I had to stop watching her streams due to time constraints, helped push me through some hard times, and also helped me to land a job as a data analyst! However, much more importantly, she indirectly helped me to meet my beautiful wife. I met my lovely wife via a friend I met within the amazing community Luna helped create. She and my son currently live in Japan, so being able to visit her has allowed me to enjoy a lot of what the amazing county has to offer. I am eternally grateful for all she has done for me and my fellow Lu-knights. Even though I do not have as much time to enjoy streams like I used to, I will always support her and wish her success. I am proud of all she has accomplished and look forward to what comes next. CIJ! Thank you. -Frozen2isPerfect",
