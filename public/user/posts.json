Thus, like Matsuri, Luna became a salvation for me during the difficult times where I was suffering from a burnout - the cure coming mainly from her piano streams and her pure, curative giggles. Luna's piano stream also, to my delight, helped me rediscover a nearly-forgotten part of my childhood through a song she played. Not to mention, I loved her willpower that not even her low stamina or at times physical injuries could stop her.\n\nWhile I could no longer dedicate myself fully on watching her streams in recent times, I will always be grateful of Luna for saving me from my burnout through her contents.",

I remember watching Himemori Luna when she was around 300,000 subscribers a few years ago. I am very happy to see hime-sama is getting the recognition she deserves. From music to gaming, she has delivered endless fun and enjoyment for all lu-knights. However, Luna-muse has actually had a much larger impact on my life than simply entertainment. This impact is two-fold. First, she was instrumental in helping encourage me in my graduate studies. Her kind words to me, before I had to stop watching her streams due to time constraints, helped push me through some hard times, and also helped me to land a job as a data analyst! However, much more importantly, she indirectly helped me to meet my beautiful wife. I met my lovely wife via a friend I met within the amazing community Luna helped create. She and my son currently live in Japan, so being able to visit her has allowed me to enjoy a lot of what the amazing county has to offer. I am eternally grateful for all she has done for me and my fellow Lu-knights. Even though I do not have as much time to enjoy streams like I used to, I will always support her and wish her success. I am proud of all she has accomplished and look forward to what comes next. CIJ! Thank you. -Frozen2isPerfect",

I may have only watched you for about 1 and a half years but still Luna is my favorite, pushing me on with a positive voice! Luna has never failed to cheer me up and make me motivated to continue what i do in my high-school routine. Whenever i am stressed or need a break, I am glad that there is Luna's cuteness to refill my energy. Luna, you everything to me so please stay safe, healthy and ongoing. I wish for Luna to continue with activities and reach greater achievements with justice! Forever CIJ!\nピンクの、可愛い、姫森ルナなのら～！4年間活動してくれてありがとうございます！まだ1年半くらいしかおしてないけど、元気な声で押してくれるルナちゃんが大好きです！ルナはいつも励まし、高校での日課を続ける意欲を与えてくれました。ストレスが溜まったときとか，ちょっと休憩したいとき、ルナのかわいさがあるので元気を充電できていつも嬉しいに感謝しています。ルナはすべてですので、安全に、健康に、そして継続してください。ルナはこれからも正義に活動を続け、更なる成果を上げて欲しいと思います！これまでずっとCIJ！",
