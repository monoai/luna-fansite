Thus, like Matsuri, Luna became a salvation for me during the difficult times where I was suffering from a burnout - the cure coming mainly from her piano streams and her pure, curative giggles. Luna's piano stream also, to my delight, helped me rediscover a nearly-forgotten part of my childhood through a song she played. Not to mention, I loved her willpower that not even her low stamina or at times physical injuries could stop her.\n\nWhile I could no longer dedicate myself fully on watching her streams in recent times, I will always be grateful of Luna for saving me from my burnout through her contents.",

I remember watching Himemori Luna when she was around 300,000 subscribers a few years ago. I am very happy to see hime-sama is getting the recognition she deserves. From music to gaming, she has delivered endless fun and enjoyment for all lu-knights. However, Luna-muse has actually had a much larger impact on my life than simply entertainment. This impact is two-fold. First, she was instrumental in helping encourage me in my graduate studies. Her kind words to me, before I had to stop watching her streams due to time constraints, helped push me through some hard times, and also helped me to land a job as a data analyst! However, much more importantly, she indirectly helped me to meet my beautiful wife. I met my lovely wife via a friend I met within the amazing community Luna helped create. She and my son currently live in Japan, so being able to visit her has allowed me to enjoy a lot of what the amazing county has to offer. I am eternally grateful for all she has done for me and my fellow Lu-knights. Even though I do not have as much time to enjoy streams like I used to, I will always support her and wish her success. I am proud of all she has accomplished and look forward to what comes next. CIJ! Thank you. -Frozen2isPerfect",

    "Luna-tan was the very first vtuber that I watched regularly. I don't remember if it was her cuteness, her comfortable stream vibe, or how funny she can be, but something about Luna-tan made me want to keep watching her, and to watch as many live streams as possible.　\nOverall, I think Luna-tan really represents what it means to be a vtuber. She is a wonderful performer, a powerful gamer, and she truly loves and cherishes the Luknights as much as we love her. No matter what she does, I have a wonderful time and feel happy afterwards!\nActually, one of my unforgettable memories is crying during Luna's performance of \"Fancy Baby Doll\" - it was the first time I had ever cried during a performance, and the first time I really understood what it really meant to support my oshi. \nTo me, Luna-tan really is my most important and irreplaceable first oshi. It's been a wonderful 3 years of laughing at her jokes, admiring her cuteness, and cheering during her moving performances on stage. Although I can't watch as many streams nowadays, I will continue to support Luna as much as I can forever. Congratulations on this huge milestone! I can't wait to see what the future has in store for you, Luna-tan!\n姫様、登録者百万人おめでとうございます！！！\nそしてもちろん、登録者百兆億万人おめでとうございます！！！",

    "Luna-hime is one of the cutest and sweetest members in Hololive, I started following in 2021 when she was only reaching 400k. \n\nWhile watching her I was able to see her grow and show everyone how smart and talented she is! Seeing her work so hard everyday and surpass her herself makes me proud and happy! She has so many new friends that care for her! 🚑💋 🍬 ♌\n\nI always make sure to be there to watch every birthday and anniversary to see her progress, even if I can't watch her daily!\n\nPlease continue supporting her! Luna is the cutest adult genius professor! My loyalty belongs with Luna-tan!! LTL! CIJ!\n\n(🍬・o・)🪄︎︎𓈒𓂂𓏸☆",

    "Luna is my saviour; my baby angel princess. She has saved my sanity through the pandemic. I feel like I would not be even alive today if it were not for her. I've been dormant in streams for quite awhile but I never stopped thinking about her. She's the reason why I push myself to become a better person so that one day I can finally thank her. <3 \n\nDeepL: ルナは私の救世主であり、天使のお姫様だ。彼女はパンデミックを通して私の正気を救ってくれた。彼女がいなかったら、私は今頃生きていなかったと思う。私はしばらくの間、ストリームの中で休眠状態だったが、彼女のことを考えるのを止めなかった。いつか彼女に感謝できる日が来るよう、より良い人間になろうと自分を奮い立たせているのは彼女のおかげだ。<3 ",
